The test in this directory uses a live Blobber server.

The test expects to find Blobber at http://localhost:3000.
If the Blobber URL is different, set BLOBBER_URL in the environment, e.g.:

  export BLOBBER_URL=https://localhost:7443/blobber

If accessing Blobber via SSL, and there are problems with a certificate,
you can set the environment variable BLOBBER_TRUST_ALL_SSL_CERTIFICATES, e.g:

  export BLOBBER_TRUST_ALL_SSL_CERTIFICATES=true

BLOBBER_TRUST_ALL_SSL_CERTIFICATES only affects the test itself; it doesn't 
change the behavior of the BlobberClient directly.

Run the test:

  rspec integration_with_live_server_spec.rb
